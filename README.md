1. 
After checking the assessment part of webpage of Assignment 1, all aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. 
Including:
-All files are in the lulu.zheng1.github.io repo.
-Git was used frequently, I tried to be as specific with my commit messages as possible.
-More than 5 rules were implemented.
-The Tufts CS account redirects to my Github account

2. 
I have discussed the assignment with classmates in class. Specifically, I asked a question to a friend about the constant flickering of my Github page after redirecting from my Tufts website. We looked on Piazza and was able to figure out the problem.

3. 
I have spent a total of around 10 hours completing the assignment.
